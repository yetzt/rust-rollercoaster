# Rust Rollercoster

![Rust Rollercoaster Scenic View](examples/1.png)

Rust Rollercoaster is a custom prefab for the game [Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com/), to be used by creators of custom game maps. It comes with a walkable rollercoaster track including a water feature and a platform. It's meant to be used with the [Trains Plugin](https://www.chaoscode.io/resources/trains.162/) made by Colon Blow. It doesn't include any loot, npc spawns or a glowing ironsight.

## Usage

[Download the file prefab files](/yetzt/rust-rollercoaster/releases/latest/download/Rollercoaster.zip) and place them in the `RustEdit/CustomPrefabs` directory of [RustEdit](https://rustedit.io/). The prefab can then be accessed in the custom section of the prefab browser. Don't forget to apply *Height*, *Topology* and *Splat* masks and break the prefab before you save the map to be used on your server.
